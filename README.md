# Homework-5-Workday-Scheduler

# Introduction
The purpose of this task was to create a working day calendar, which held the information which was input. This data would be held in local storage. Once this time had past the the row would become grey to show that the time had past, red when the time was the present time and the time of the future should be shown in green. On top of this it should show the current working dayâ€™s date on top of the calendar.
