# Homework-5-Workday-Scheduler

# Introduction
The purpose of this task was to create a working day calendar, which held the information which was input. This data would be held in local storage. Once this time had past the the row would become grey to show that the time had past, red when the time was the present time and the time of the future should be shown in green. On top of this it should show the current working day’s date on top of the calendar. 

### What I learnt?
I learnt the use of of JQuery within my code, to make the contents of the calendar. The html and css were already built, which was handy but the most important part, which was the functionality this was covered by  the JQuery code. It was important to understand how to use the libraries which were available and implement this within the site. This was difficult to begin with as it had never been done before by myself, but I believe I have done it successfully to get the result that was required from the acceptance criteria. 

#### For the future 
For the future I would like to incorporate what I have learnt when using Jquery. Whether it be the use of the various libraries available or showing that I am cable of understanding what is being done, but most importantly bringing it all together with the HTML and CSS. As this is what makes a site look average, to great. I’m still not as comfortable as I like to be with it, as there’s a long way to go, but I’m confident that I will get there!
